# Solvewith.us #

Various MIT Mystery Hunts have come up with systems (or applications)
to keep track of puzzles that are being solved and to associated
Google Sheets (and possibly other files) with them.

This is the application written for Beginner's Luck in 201_ by Eric
Prestemon, with incremental improvements since.

## Current State ##

Currently the code is custom to the setup on https://solvewith.us,
with crudely commented out secrets/keys/passwords.

## Plans ##

  * Document technical requirements/versions for install
  * Improve installation on other hosts
  * Test coverage

### Possible Future Projects ###

(Larger, talk to ecp@prestemon.com if you want to help!)

  * Integrate shared-canvas puzzle solving app (code is included but it's primitive and separate)
  * Port back end from Perl to python or javascript
  * Front end improvements
